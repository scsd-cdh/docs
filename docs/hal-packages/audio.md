# Audio

## Introduction

This is intended for audio-related functionalities in a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) context. Let's break down the key components and concepts in this code:



## Breaking down the [Audio](https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library/blob/master/hal/src/hal-audio.ads) code step by step

- pragma Preelaborate;:

Similar to the previous code snippet, this pragma indicates that the package is preelaborated, meaning that its subprograms are elaborated at the start of the program execution.

- Audio_Buffer Type:

Audio_Buffer is an array type of 16-bit signed integers (Integer_16).
It is designed to hold audio data.
The Component_Size attribute specifies that each element in the array is 16 bits, and the Alignment attribute specifies that the elements are aligned to 2-byte boundaries.

- Audio_Volume Type:

Audio_Volume is a new subtype of Natural, which restricts values to a range between 0 and 100.
This type is used to represent audio volume levels.

- Audio_Frequency Enumeration:

Audio_Frequency is an enumeration type that represents different audio frequency options.
Each option corresponds to a specific sample rate (e.g., 8kHz, 11kHz, etc.).
The Size attribute specifies that each value requires 32 bits of storage.
The for Audio_Frequency use section provides mappings of enumeration values to their corresponding integer values (sample rates).

- Audio_Stream Type:

Audio_Stream is defined as a limited interface type. It appears to be a generic interface for audio streaming operations.
Limited interfaces define a set of operations that types implementing the interface must provide.


- Set_Frequency Procedure:

Set_Frequency is an abstract procedure that takes an Audio_Stream and an Audio_Frequency as inputs.
This procedure is used to set the sample rate (audio frequency) for the audio stream.
The implementation of this procedure is expected to be provided by types that implement the Audio_Stream interface.

- Transmit Procedure:

Transmit is an abstract procedure that takes an Audio_Stream and an Audio_Buffer as inputs.
It is used to transmit audio data through the audio stream.
The implementation of this procedure is expected to be provided by types that implement the Audio_Stream interface.

- Receive Procedure:

Receive is an abstract procedure that takes an Audio_Stream and an output Audio_Buffer.
This procedure is used to receive audio data from the audio stream.
Like the other abstract procedures, its implementation is expected to be provided by types that implement the Audio_Stream interface.

Overall, this package specification defines a set of types, enumerations, and procedures for audio-related operations. It provides a foundation for implementing audio streaming functionality while ensuring proper alignment and handling of audio data. Users of this package can create specific implementations of the Audio_Stream interface for their audio hardware.
